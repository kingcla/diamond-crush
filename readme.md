A simple "Candy Crush" clone in C++.

## Development

This game development is purely for educational purpose and it comes with many mistakes, but it was a very good exercise to learn C++ and game development from the basics.

I used Code::Blocks as IDE and C++ compiler.

I had a lot of fun looking for sounds, images, fonts and sprites in [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org). I also implemented a rudimentary UI and splash screen with instructions.

A complicated part was to show the fuse animation and make it follow a defined path on the screen. I am very proud of how it turned out.

"**Cirase Game**" is my fake game studio name, inspired by the dialect name 'cirase' from south of Italy. Cirase is how we call cherries :D

## Play

A Windows executable is available in the releases tab.
